    "`False` and the operators AND (conjunction, denoted by\n",
    "$\\wedge$), OR (disjunction, denoted by $\\vee$), and negation (denoted\n",
    "by $\\neg$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We need a few more definitions:\n",
    "* A **literal** is either a variable (a positive literal), or the\n",
    "negation of a variable (a negative literal). \n",
    "* A **clause** is a disjunction of literals or a single literal.\n",
    "* A formula is in **conjunctive normal form** (CNF) if it is a conjunction of clauses or a single clause.\n",

    "\\vee x_4) \\wedge (\\neg x_1 \\vee x_2 \\vee \\neg x_4)$ is in CNF.\n",

Each clause is a sequence of distinct non-null numbers between `-nbvar` and `nbvar` ending with a 0 (the 0 does not refer to any variable); it cannot contain the opposite literals i and -i simultaneously. A positive number denotes the corresponding variable. A negative number denotes the negation of the corresponding variable.\n",

    "As you can see, both versions of hill climbing have better results than the other algorithms, and were close to solving for the solution. Hill climbing did take longer, but if you increase the number of restarts hill climbing would eventually be able to find a solution. I believe hill climbing without restarts was so close to finding a solution because using all false values as an initial state was already pretty close to the solution. Genetic and simulated annealing algorithms had similar total times and highest clause satisfaction (HCS), which was interesting. I suspect it's because I'm using the default scheduling algorithm for simulated annealing. I also found 200 to be a good fitness threshold for the genetic algorithm because it increases the HCS a good amount. But anything above 200 significantly increasing the total time. I used 30 as the number of iterations for hill climbing with random restarts for the same reason, any more increases total time too much, any less reduces HCS. I chose to use the crossover and mutation functions provided in search.py because there's not anything I'd want to change. "
